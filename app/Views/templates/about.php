    <h1 class="title">What is this!</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">This is only a spare time project to retake the PHP coding I left behind for about 25 years or more.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">The project is made with <strong><a href="https://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter 4</a></strong> and with <strong><a href="https://bulma.io">BulmaCSS</a></strong>, I love both projects.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">There's a lot todo with it I want to <strong>make a user login</strong> to let people voting on games and so on, but this will come with time.</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Hope you enjoy, and if you have some idea to implement just send me a note to <strong>jolupameister at gmail dot com</strong>.</p>
